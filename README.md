# hey

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/hey.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/hey)

Previously known as [github.com/rakyll/boom](https://github.com/rakyll/boom).

Requires go 1.7 or greater.

----

hey is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application.

hey was originally called boom and was influenced from Tarek Ziade's
tool at [tarekziade/boom](https://github.com/tarekziade/boom). Using the same name was a mistake as it resulted in cases
where binary name conflicts created confusion.
To preserve the name for its original owner, we renamed this project to hey.
